### versions

    - ks_2018b2.rs: dp loop version, all Vec, ~200s (locally large set)
    - ks_2018b2_unsafe.rs (can PASS kickstart): recurrsive version with check, asides static array, ptr::write_bytes(C version memset) to avoid loop. ~19s (locally large set)


### tests
    
    - naive -> static array. 200s -> 100s
    - u64 -> f64. 100s -> 90s; (but accruracy error make some tests WRONG)
    - -> recursive with check, (loop set 0 ok(check flag)); -> 50s
    - -> memset ok; 20s. PASSED.
    - there are still room to speed-up. but since passed, done here ;)


### notes

    - static array is good. based on above, speed 2x faster (stack vs heap).  
    - loop or iterator, still cost a lot. 
        - I write a 100x2^16 for-loop(or iter) with doing nothing, guess what, 200~300 ms; which means with 100 test points. 20s~30s won't pass the TIME LIMIT 20s.
        - check this [runtime analysis](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/the-importance-of-algorithms/)
        - although T x 0(10^7) results ~10s, since the TIME LIMITS ~20s so tight. we have to do some constant optimization.
    - std::{ptr, mem} is a good thing, I searched 'libc's memset, but std is good enough, and for OJ using.


### conclusion

    - if you want 2~10 times faster, welcome to unsafe.
